%
%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation

%    % --- sample stuff only -----
%    special stuff for my document, but you don't need it in your thesis

% ========== Chapters

% Chapter 1
\chapter{Introduction}
\noindent \emph{``Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in this universe, are challenged by this point of pale light''} - Carl Sagan in The Pale Blue Dot
\newpage

% Part 1
\part{Atmospheric Biosignatures, and Life's Impact on the Early Earth} \label{pt:1}
 
% Chapter 2
\chapter{Atmospheric Chemical Disequilibrium from Dead to Living Worlds} \label{ch:2}
\noindent \emph{``Thus the disequilibrium abundance of CH$_4$ in the Earth's oxidizing atmosphere is found by ground-based observations to be indeed caused by biology, as naive consideration of the Galileo data would suggest.''} - \citet{Sagan_1993}
\newpage
\include{tex/2diseq.tex}

% Chapter 3
\chapter{The Likelihood of CH\textsubscript{4}+CO\textsubscript{2} Biosignature False Positives from Volcanism} \label{ch:3}
\newpage
\include{tex/3methane.tex}

% Chapter 4
\chapter{Rapid timescale for an oxic transition during the Great Oxidation Event and the instability of low atmospheric O\textsubscript{2}} \label{ch:4}
\newpage
\include{tex/4goe.tex}

% Part 2
\part{Origin of life atmospheric chemistry} \label{pt:2}

% Chapter 5
\chapter{Origin of Life Molecules in the Atmosphere After Big Impacts on the Early Earth} \label{ch:5}
\noindent \emph{``At the time such objects were falling on the moon similar objects fell on the Earth... Its materials would have fallen through the atmosphere in the form of iron and silicate rains and would have reacted with the atmosphere in the process... Thus it is very difficult to see how the primitive atmosphere of the Earth contained more than trace amounts of other compounds of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen than CH$_4$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$ (or N$_2$) and H$_2$.''} - \citet{Urey_1952}
\newpage
\include{tex/5impacts.tex}

% Chapter 6
\chapter{Timing and Likelihood of the Origin of Life Derived from Post-Impact Highly Reducing Atmospheres} \label{ch:6}
\noindent \emph{``At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the Replicator. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself. This may seem a very unlikely sort of accident to happen. So it was. It was exceedingly improbable... But in our human estimates of what is probable and what is not, we are not used to dealing in hundreds of millions of years.''} - Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene
